# SQL Learning Repository
This repository is organized to support SQL learners and practitioners at all levelsâ€”beginner, intermediate, and advanced. It contains three SQL files that progressively cover foundational to expert-level topics, using sample data from EmployeeDemographics and EmployeeSalary.

- Beginner: Learn to create databases and tables, insert data, and run basic SELECT queries using filters, aggregation, and sorting.

- Intermediate: Explore joins, unions, case statements, data manipulation, views, and key SQL functions like GETDATE() and PARTITION BY.

- Advanced: Dive into Common Table Expressions (CTEs), temp tables, stored procedures, string manipulation functions, subqueries, and data import/export techniques.

Ideal for self-study, interviews, and skill refreshers.
